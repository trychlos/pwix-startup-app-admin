|    3 | 2023- 6- 5 | Change pckTemplate to exportedObject |
|      | 2023- 6- 5 | done: SAA |
|    4 | 2023- 6- 5 | Change PCK_ to PREFIX_ |
|      | 2023- 6- 5 | done: SAA_ |
|    5 | 2023- 6- 7 | Customize the email verification email |
|      | 2024- 6- 3 | done |
|    6 | 2023- 6- 7 | Have a responsive width for the display |
|      | 2023- 6- 7 | done |
|    7 | 2023- 6- 7 | There are too many alerts and boxes - to be decreased |
|      |            | - when creating the account, two alerts -> pwix:bootbox has to be fixed to not override the first with the second |
|      |            | - when validating an email, a first modal + a second modal, which overlaps the first without a good reason |
|      | 2023- 6- 8 | bootbox alerts are now stacked with v 1.2.0 |
|      | 2023- 6- 8 | pwix:accounts take into account onVerifiedEmail configuration |
|      | 2023- 6- 8 | done |
|    8 | 2023- 6- 7 | when validating an email, should not re-display the signup div - use the route to display something other |
|      | 2023- 6- 9 | Though this is not very clean, we must let the user another chance to define another account |
|      | 2023- 6- 9 | done |
|    9 | 2023- 6- 8 | Have a way to say the user he is an admin |
|      |            | this is difficult because: |
|      |            | - it is not possible to temporarily override the pwix:accounts display options as verifying an email |
|      |            |   implies to reload the page, thus to reinitialize the packages configurations and so overrides are lost |
|      |            | - the pwix:accounts email verification function defaults to display a confirmation dialog box; |
|      |            |   it seems inappropriate to display another dialog box on top of the previous |
|      |            | - because there is already a dialog box on the screen at this time, a tolert alert is not appropriate either |
|      |            | Other possible ways: |
|      |            | - at startup, override if not yet any admin, but getting the admin count arrives long time after the startup! |
|      |            | - use localStorage to survive the reloads |
|      | 2023- 6- 9 | done |
|   10 | 2023- 6- 9 | upgrade bootbox to 1.3.0 (use onVerifiedEmailCb) |
|      | 2023- 6- 9 | done |
|   11 | 2023- 6- 9 | Decrease the application integration footprint |
|      | 2023- 6- 9 | done |
|   12 | 2023- 6-12 | Have SAA.i18n.namespace() to let another package add a translation to this one |
|      | 2023- 6-12 | done |
|   13 | 2023- 6-22 | Default stylesheet should better emphasize of title and subtitles (input label are last, then input group titles, then dialog subtitles, and at last dialog title) |
|      | 2023- 6-23 | done |
|   14 | 2023- 6-22 | The end (And voilÃ ,....) should only be displayed after the user has created his account) - click sign-up, display the message, click another button to go on |
|      | 2023- 7- 5 | the message is reviewed to better suit the workflow |
|   15 | 2023- 7- 4 | Bump pwix:accounts-ui to 1.3.0 (when released) |
|      | 2023- 9- 5 | done |
|   16 | 2023- 7- 4 | _setOptions() doesn't display the right message when an email is verified |
|      | 2023- 7- 5 | the setOptions() dynamic is reviewed |
|   17 | 2023- 7- 5 | be verbose for countAdmins |
|      | 2024- 6- 2 | done (but do not know when) |
|   19 | 2023- 7- 5 | the verification dialog doesn't have title but should |
|      | 2024- 6- 3 | it does have -> closed |
|   20 | 2023- 7- 5 | the verification dialog is not horizontally centered but should |
|      | 2023- 7- 5 | fixed when errors are removed |
|   21 | 2023- 7- 5 | pwix:modal has an error message when displaying the verification dialog |
|      | 2023- 7- 5 | fixed pwix:modal stack management |
|   22 | 2023- 7- 5 | protect onCreateUser and onEmailVerified to not run when no more needed (invalid the package) |
|      | 2023- 7- 6 | done (i hope) will need a user manager to assert that |
|   24 | 2023- 7- 5 | 'no close at the moment' message after ack of user creation - stack trace is functions:62 ac_render_modal:43 bootbox_ack:handlers:76 md-close:bb_dialog:130 |
|      | 2024- 6- 2 | not reproductible - closed |
|   25 | 2023- 9- 5 | review the top text of the main panel where the 'application' word appears twice |
|      | 2024- 6- 2 | done |
|   26 | 2023- 9- 5 | at creation of the first admin, we send a tolert and a confirmation dialog |
|      |            | if the two are needed and provide different informations, they should not overlap => dialog should be moved to the bottom |
|      |            | note: this is a bootbox displayed from handlers.onUserCreated() |
|      | 2024- 6- 2 | done, requiring pwix:modal 1.11.0-rc |
|   27 | 2023- 9- 5 | review the text of the secondary panel: we do not want 'try', we do want define |
|      | 2023-11-13 | done |
|   28 | 2023- 9-12 | provide a Blaze helper which tests for admin count |
|      | 2023-11-13 | cancelled as our helpers have to test for package presence first |
|   29 | 2024- 6- 2 | after user creation, we still display the saa icon (but no more the acUserLogin), disappears on dialog acknowledge |
|      | 2024- 6- 3 | fixed in accounts-ui |
|   30 | 2024- 6- 2 | while waiting for email verification, the text is no more horizontally centered (regression) |
|      | 2024- 6- 3 | fixed |
